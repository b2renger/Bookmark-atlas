# Development log

Where the project stands, newest entry first. Each entry says what works, what
was decided and what comes next. Commit messages carry the same information in
short form, so `git log` reads as a history of the project's state.

## 2026-11-11: phase 1, export and status

**Works**

- `atlas export --format csv|json [-o FILE] [--include-deleted]`.
- `atlas status`: counts of bookmarks, deleted, source records, records waiting
  for review, tags, and fields still empty.
- README explains how to run everything so far.

**Checked on the real export**

- CSV and JSON exports both hold 956 bookmarks, in the same order, with the
  same tags.
- Status after import: 6 records waiting for review, 1,843 of 2,368 tags used
  only once, 439 bookmarks without a save date, none with a publication date or
  platform yet. These are the numbers phase 2 should move.

**Decided**

- Exports contain curated fields only: no source records, no journal.
- In CSV, tags share one column joined by ", ", as Notion does. In JSON they
  are a list.
- Deleted and merged bookmarks are left out unless `--include-deleted` is given.

**Not done in phase 1 yet**

- Notion sync (`atlas connect`, `atlas sync`). It needs a Notion connection
  token and the table shared with it, and should be tested against the real
  API, not only against fakes.

**Next**

- Either the Notion sync, or phase 2 grooming on the CSV-imported data. The
  two are independent.

## 2026-11-11: phase 1, CSV import

**Works**

- `atlas import-csv <file>` with `--dry-run` and `--column field=header`.
- Rows are matched to bookmarks by normalised URL. New links become bookmarks;
  links already known are stored as source records and never overwrite
  anything.
- Importing the same file twice writes nothing.
- A bookmark deleted locally stays deleted when its link is imported again.
- A whole file is one transaction: it all succeeds or nothing is written.

**Checked on the real export (962 rows)**

- 956 bookmarks created, 6 rows recognised as duplicates and held for review.
  Three of them have identical URLs. The other three were only found through
  normalisation: a tracking parameter, a YouTube share parameter, and the same
  X post under two account paths. All six are true duplicates.
- 439 dates have no time of day and were left empty on purpose.
- A second import reported 962 rows already imported and created nothing.

**Decided**

- Exact duplicates collapse at import, because the normalised URL is the only
  key a CSV row has. The first row creates the bookmark; later rows for the
  same link are kept as pending source records. Their tags are not merged in
  automatically.
- A date with a time of day goes to `saved_at` (source `date_column`). A date
  without one is ambiguous (save day or publication day), so both date fields
  stay empty and the original value remains in the source record for the
  `split-dates` script.
- `platform` is not filled at import. It is the job of `derive-platform`.
- Tags are stored exactly as written. Normalising them is grooming.
- URL rules so far: scheme, `www.`, fragment, trailing slash and tracking
  parameters are ignored; twitter.com is x.com; an X post is identified by its
  ID alone; a YouTube video by its `v` parameter; GitHub owner and repository
  names are case-insensitive.

**Next**

- `atlas export` and `atlas status`, then the Notion sync.

## 2026-11-11: phase 0, scaffolding

**Works**

- Python package `atlas` under `src/`, standard library only.
- `atlas init` creates the SQLite file and applies migrations.
- Schema version 1: bookmarks, source records, tags, sync state, grooming
  journal, meta.

**Decided**

- Migrations are numbered SQL files in `src/atlas/migrations`. The schema
  version lives in `meta.schema_version`. Commands refuse to run on an outdated
  database and say to run `atlas init`.
- Opening a database that does not exist is an error, so a typo in `--db`
  cannot silently start an empty collection.
- Analysis and saved-view tables are not created yet. They arrive as their own
  migrations with the phases that use them.
- `source_records` gained a `raw_hash` column compared with the first plan, to
  recognise an unchanged record on re-import.
- No continuous integration yet. Tests run locally with `pytest`.

**Next**

- Phase 1: CSV import, then export and status.
